# Introduction to LLMs using Langchain
Examples of different use cases of Large Language Models (LLMs), going from basic to more advanced.

The LLM application framework [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/) is used to simplify the code.

Examples include:
- Context as input to LLM
- Embeddings, including 2D visualization
- Vector databases
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tools (provide custom functions to LLM)

The examples also briefly cover chains and agents:
- Chain: hardcoded sequence of actions
- Agent: use LLM to choose sequence of actions to take

# Setup
Environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` needs to be set before running any of the examples.
