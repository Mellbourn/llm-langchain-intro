# Intro to generative AI using LLMs
Examples of different use cases of Large Language Models (LLMs), going from basic to more advanced.

The LLM application framework [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/) is used to simplify the code.

Examples include:
- Context as input to LLM
- Embeddings
- Vector databases
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
